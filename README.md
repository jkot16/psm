# PSM – Fundamentals of Computer Simulation (PJATK, 2025)

This repository contains lab assignments from the "Fundamentals of Computer Simulation" course at PJATK.
Each project simulates a physical system using basic numerical methods in Java.

## Labs Overview

- **Lab 2 – Projectile Motion Simulation**  
  Simulates 2D projectile motion with and without air resistance using two numerical methods:  
  Euler Method and Midpoint (RK2). Includes velocity, position, and time tracking.  
  *Goal: Learn how to model and simulate real-world motion using numerical integration methods.*

---

- **Lab 3 – Pendulum Energy Simulation**  
  Simulates the motion of a simple pendulum using Heun and RK4 methods.  
  Tracks angular dynamics and energy conservation over time.  
  *Goal: Understand energy transformations and numerical stability in oscillatory systems.*

- **Lab 4 – Rolling Objects on an Incline**  
  Simulates the motion and energy of rolling objects (sphere vs. cylinder) on an inclined plane using Midpoint integration. Includes position, rotation angle, and total energy tracking with live charts.  
  *Goal: Understand the dynamics of rotational motion and compare how moment of inertia affects movement and energy conservation.*

- **Lab 5 – Moon–Earth–Sun System Simulation**  
  Simulates the motion of the Earth and the Moon orbiting around the Sun using the Midpoint (Improved Euler) method.  
  Visualizes relative trajectories and exaggerates the Moon’s orbit for clarity.  
  Tracks positions, velocities, and interactions due to gravitational forces between all three bodies.  
  *Goal: Explore multi-body gravitational dynamics and numerical integration stability in orbital mechanics.*
