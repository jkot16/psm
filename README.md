# PSM – Fundamentals of Computer Simulation (PJATK, 2025)

This repository contains lab assignments from the "Fundamentals of Computer Simulation" course at PJATK.
Each project simulates a physical system using basic numerical methods in Java.

## Labs Overview

- **Lab 2 – Projectile Motion Simulation**  
  Simulates 2D projectile motion with and without air resistance using two numerical methods:  
  Euler Method and Midpoint (RK2). Includes velocity, position, and time tracking.

---

- **Lab 3 – Pendulum Energy Simulation**  
  Simulates the motion of a simple pendulum using Heun and RK4 methods.  
  Tracks angular dynamics and energy conservation over time.  
  *Goal: Understand energy transformations and numerical stability in oscillatory systems.*
